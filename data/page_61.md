![The image shows a terminal command and error message on a gradient blue background. The command is attempting to push code to a Git repository. The text reads: → ~/my_project git:\(branch_name\) git push remote: error GH009: Secrets detected! This push failed.](https://images.ctfassets.net/8aevphvgewt8/3LPkaw75xR2vJxn85BMmWc/e04c21b3d6dc3c61692efa47e70c46c1/Image_8.webp?fm=webp)
Push protection automatically blocks secrets before they reach your repository, keeping code clean without disrupting workflows.

### [Find and fix vulnerabilities in your code](https://github.com/security/advanced-security/code-security?locale=en-US)
![The image displays a code snippet with an AI-suggested fix. The code is written in JavaScript and is shown on a blue gradient background.
