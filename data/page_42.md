GitHub Actions
# Automate your workflow from idea to production
GitHub Actions makes it easy to automate all your software workflows, now with world-class CI/CD. Build, test, and deploy your code right from GitHub. Make code reviews, branch management, and issue triaging work the way you want. 
[Get started with actions](https://docs.github.com/actions)[Contact sales](https://github.com/enterprise/contact?ref_cta=Contact+Sales&ref_loc=hero&ref_page=%2Ffeatures%2Factions&scid=&utm_campaign=Actions_feature_page_contact_sales_cta_utmroutercampaign&utm_content=Actions&utm_medium=site&utm_source=github)
![Screenshot of a GitHub Actions workflow titled 'matrix-build-deploy.yml' displaying a pipeline with three stages: Build, Test, and Publish. The Build stage has completed successfully in 1 minute and 42 seconds. The Test stage includes builds for Linux, macOS, and Windows, all of which have also completed successfully with their respective durations. The final stage, Publish, shows that the publishing steps for Linux, macOS, and Windows are pending and waiting for approval. The background features a gradient transitioning from green to blue to turquoise.](https://images.ctfassets.net/8aevphvgewt8/KiQBgcnMQg6dALaS6erGk/f8d49c0cc5a461b903e52d08c3c3b8f6/actions-hero.webp?fm=webp)
## Kick off workflows on any GitHub event to automate tasks  

### Hosted runners
Linux, macOS, Windows, ARM, GPU, and containers make it easy to build and test all your projects. Run directly on a VM or inside a container. Use your own VMs, in the cloud or on-prem, with self-hosted runners.  

### Matrix builds
Save time with matrix workflows that simultaneously test across multiple operating systems and versions of your runtime.  
  

### Any language
GitHub Actions supports Node.js, Python, Java, Ruby, PHP, Go, Rust, .NET, and more. Build, test, and deploy applications in your language of choice.  
  

### Live logs
See your workflow run in realtime with color and emoji. It’s one click to copy a link that highlights a specific line number to share a CI/CD failure.  

### Built in secret store
Automate your software development practices with workflow files embracing the Git flow by codifying it in your repository.  

### Multi-container testing
Test your web service and its DB in your workflow by simply adding some docker-compose to your workflow file.  

### Run a workflow on any event
Whether you want to build a container, deploy a web service, or automate welcoming new users to your open source projects—there's an action for that. Pair GitHub Packages with Actions to simplify package management, including version updates, fast distribution with our global CDN, and dependency resolution, using your existing GITHUB_TOKEN.
![Screenshot showing the results of a successful GitHub Actions workflow. The header indicates that 'All checks have passed,' with three successful checks listed below. The checks include 'Build,' which completed successfully in 42 seconds, 'Test,' which completed in 5 minutes, and 'Code scanning / CodeQL,' which completed in 30 seconds. Each check has a corresponding 'Details' link. At the bottom, there is a green 'Merge pull request' button, indicating that the pull request is ready to be merged. The background features a gradient from green to teal.](https://images.ctfassets.net/8aevphvgewt8/1e4I96ILCuSCaiFUQMeLLW/a78a371df7b10914a8f2099a0c95ab0b/features-action-river-event.webp)
### Actions marketplace
![Screenshot of a GitHub Actions workflow file being edited. The cursor is in the 'on' section of the YAML file, with a dropdown menu showing various triggers such as push, issue_creation, new_release, workflow_dispatch, and others. The code includes steps to set up a Node.js environment and run tests. On the right side of the screen, there is a 'Marketplace' panel displaying featured actions like 'Setup Node.js environment,' 'Setup Java JDK,' 'Setup .NET Core SDK,' and 'Download a Build Artifact.' The background features a gradient from green to teal.](https://images.ctfassets.net/8aevphvgewt8/5kVxaacutdvGyusbgk64iw/23fa8c76260945d6a8f28327e9910397/actions-river-breakout.webp)
_GitHub Actions connects all of your tools_ to automate every step of your development workflow. 
[Explore the actions marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions)
  * Easily deploy to any cloud, create tickets in Jira, or publish a package to npm.
  * _Want to venture off the beaten path?_ Use the millions of open source libraries available on GitHub to create your own actions. Write them in JavaScript or create a container action—both can interact with the full GitHub API and any other public API.


### Secure package registry for code and workflows
Securely store and manage your code and packages with GitHub credentials, integrated into your workflows via APIs and webhooks. Enjoy fast, reliable downloads through a global CDN for optimized performance.
