![Screenshot of a GitHub Discussions page for the ’octoinvaders’ project, showing categorized discussion threads with tags like ’answered’ and ’Long term.’ The interface features playful elements like a mona emjoi and a rocket icon, highlighting community interaction.](https://images.ctfassets.net/8aevphvgewt8/8ancmxwVvvSBuGiVfZCQ0/0e08bafd454ff1c993977c892581065d/discussions-hero.webp?fm=webp)
## Dedicated space for conversations  

Decrease the burden of managing active work in issues and pull requests by providing a separate space to host ongoing discussions, questions, and ideas.  

### Highlight quality responses and make the best answer more discoverable.
![The image is a screenshot of a forum discussion. The first comment, posted by "khayrizen" on March 22, 2022, asks for brainstorming new power-up ideas for a character named Mona. This comment has received 8 thumbs-up reactions and 5 up votes. Below it, "pavbez" responds, suggesting that a character named Hubot could deliver the power-ups, giving Mona superpowers similar to those provided by GitHub. The discussion highlights community engagement with reactions and replies.

### Keep context in-tact and conversations on track with threaded comments.
![The image is a screenshot of a conversation thread on a social media platform. The first comment is from "hankzolo" 20 minutes ago, suggesting that a power-up could call Hubot to reveal the path and protect Mona for a set period of time. This comment has received 5 likes and 5 replies. The second comment is from "pavbez" 18 minutes ago, proposing that Hubot could provide different types of power-ups or objects depending on levels. The third comment is from "hsiaohype" 15 minutes ago, expressing appreciation for the collaboration idea and stating it is perfect for the characters.

### Ask your community directly with custom polls.
![The image is a screenshot of a poll created by a user named "khayrizen" in the Feedback section, 10 minutes ago. The poll is titled "Power-up contest" and includes the following message: "I got a bunch of really cool ideas from y'all about how Hubot will help Mona in her quest. Now we need to choose the one we'll implement in the game. Pick your favorite!" Below this message, there are three options for what Mona needs: "Magic portals" with 24% of votes, "Her sidekick Hubot" with 51% of votes, and "A jetpack" with 25% of votes. The background is pink with rounded corners on the image.

### Leverage GraphQL API and webhooks to meet your teams wherever they are.
![The image is a screenshot of a Slack channel named "#community" within the "OctoSlack" workspace, which is part of the "Octoinvader-community." The background is pink with rounded corners. There are two messages from a user named "Robotocat." The first message announces a new poll created by another user, khayrizen, and includes a link to the "#1238 Power-up contest" discussion on GitHub. The second message indicates that glebosonic voted in the Power-up contest. The interface displays options for viewing pinned items, searching within the channel, and seeing member details.

### Give your open ended conversations the room they need outside of issues.
![The image is a screenshot of a discussion thread titled "Gameplay improvements #1192" marked as "Closed." Two comments are visible in the thread. The first comment is by a user named semyonrush, posted 10 minutes ago, saying, "Thanks for all the work on the latest updates to our game. This got me thinking, should we think about adding power-ups?" The second comment is by a user named khayrizen, posted 8 minutes ago, saying, "Let's move this conversation out of our mechanics work and ask the community." There are reaction icons below khayrizen's comment showing 5 thumbs up and 2 eyes emojis.
