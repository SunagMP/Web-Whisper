A Copilot chat window with the 'Ask' mode enabled. The user switches from 'Ask' mode to 'Agent' mode from a dropdown menu, then sends the prompt 'Update the website to allow searching for running races by name.' Copilot analyzes the codebase, then explains the required edits for three files before generating them. Copilot then confirms completion and summarizes the implemented changes for the new functionality allowing users to search races by name and view paginated, filtered results.
