Code Search
# Exactly what you’re looking for
Your code—and the world’s—is at your fingertips.
[Try it now](https://github.com/search?type=code)[Contact sales](https://github.com/enterprise/contact?ref_cta=Contact+sales&ref_loc=hero&ref_page=%2Ffeatures%2Fcode-search&utm_content=Platform&utm_medium=site&utm_source=github)
![The image shows a computer screen with a code editor in dark mode, displaying a Rust programming language file named "vfmt.rs" from the GitHub repository "github.com/servo/rust-url." The left sidebar lists folders and files, while the main editor displays syntax-highlighted Rust code. Two floating panels on the right provide information about a class named "CodePoint" and search results for "impl CodePoint".

](https://images.ctfassets.net/8aevphvgewt8/4zdWoJhLRcNgdkRQn7lBG4/3467a5833e1b04ac12fd7f608d26dadb/code-search-hero.webp?fm=webp)
## Search, navigate, and understand your   
team’s code—and billions of lines of   
public code.  

### Fast, relevant results
Code search understands your code—and brings you relevant results with incredible speed.  

### A power user's dream
Search using regular expressions, boolean operations, keyboard shortcuts, and more.  

### More than just search
Dig deeper with the all-new code view—tightly integrating browsing and code navigation.  

## Way more than grep.  

GitHub code search can search across multiple repositories and is always up to date. It understands your code, and puts the most relevant results first.  

### Use the new search input to find symbols and files—and jump right to them.
![The image shows a search interface with the query "repo:rust-lang/rust CodePoint" entered in the search bar. Below the search bar, several results are listed under the "Code" section, including "class CodePoint" in "library/wtf8.rs" and "function CodePoint::from_u32_unchecked" in "library/std/src/sys_common/wtf8.rs." Each result has a "Jump to" link for navigation.

### Know exactly what you’re looking for? Express it with our powerful search operators.
![The image displays three search queries. The first query is "org:rust-lang 'fatal error' NOT 'warning'". The second query is "/limits?/ repo:tensorflow/tensorflow". The third query is "validation \(language:ruby OR language:python\)". This image demonstrates examples of advanced search syntax, likely for use in a code repository or documentation search tool. It highlights the use of specific keywords, logical operators, and regular expressions to refine search results.

## Meet the all-new code view.  

Dig deeper into complex codebases with tightly integrated search, code navigation and browsing.  

### Instantly jump to definitions in over 10 languages. No setup required with Code navigation.
![The image shows a code editor interface with a dark theme. The screen displays information about a symbol named "CodePoint." It indicates that precise symbol matching has found 1 definition and 13 references for this symbol. There is an option to search for this symbol in all repositories. The definition of "CodePoint" is highlighted on line 45 with the code pub struct CodePoint {. Below, there are 24 references listed, including lines such as impl fmt::Debug for CodePoint { on line 51 and impl CodePoint { on line 58.

### Keep all your code in context and instantly switch files with the new file tree pane.
![The image shows a screenshot of a file directory in a code repository, likely from GitHub. The directory is named "main" and contains several folders and files. The folders listed are ".github," ".reuse," "LICENSES," "library," and "src." Within the "library" folder, there are four files: "backtrace.rs," "condvar.rs," "fs.rs," and "wtf8.rs."
