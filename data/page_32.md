GitHub Issues
# Project planning for developers
Create issues, break them into sub-issues, track progress, add custom fields, and have conversations. Visualize large projects as tables, boards, or roadmaps, and automate everything with code.
[Start using projects](https://docs.github.com/issues)[Contact sales](https://github.com/enterprise/contact?ref_cta=Contact+sales&ref_loc=hero&ref_page=%2Ffeatures%2Fissues&utm_content=Platform&utm_medium=site&utm_source=github)
![The image shows a project management dashboard for "OctoArcade Invaders." It is divided into three sections: "Prototype," "Beta," and "Launch." Each section lists tasks with their status, assignees, and progress. Tasks are labeled as "Complete," "In Progress," or "Not Started," with corresponding icons and progress bars indicating completion percentages.

## Break issues into sub-issues
Tackle complex issues with sub-issues and track their status with progress indicators. Navigate the full scope of work all in one view.
![The image shows a project management interface with tasks and issues listed. The background is purple, and there are three overlapping task cards. The top card has a green "Open" status label and is titled "Task: Updates to aliens and cannon game logic." The middle card has a purple "Closed" status label and is titled "Update collision logic." The bottom card, which is the most detailed, has a green "Open" status label and is titled "New rendering engine #920." It includes comments from a user named 'carlawonders' who commented 5 days ago about follow-up work on the new rendering engine. There are sub-issues listed under this task, including Intelligent Chatbot Support, User profiling and segmentation, User interface design for AI integration, Real-time tracking of user behavior and preferences, and Documentation and user guides

## Streamline conversations
Express ideas with GitHub Flavored Markdown, mention contributors, react with emoji, clarify with attachments, and see references from commits, pull requests, releases, and deploys. Coordinate by assigning contributors and teams, or by adding them to milestones and projects. All in a single timeline.
  * Upload and attach videos to comments
  * Dive into work faster with issue forms and templates


![The image shows a project management interface with a teal to purple gradient background. At the top, there is a green "Open" label and "3 tasks" listed under the heading "Improve alien character controls." Below this, there are three task cards. The first card is from user rajqflow, posted 5 days ago, discussing feedback from testers about sprite animations and tagging users @inesvibe, @hanksolo, and @chieda to share the beta tester report. The second card is from user inesvibe, posted 5 days ago, announcing that they have published the report with a link to octocoradeo/testerlist#13. The third card is from user khayrizen again, posted 4 days ago, mentioning dark mode support for UI #179588.

## Features
![The image shows a project management interface with a dark theme, likely from a software development tool. The interface is divided into several sections. On the left side, there are squads listed "Squad 1" with 12 items, "Squad 2" with 3 items, and "Squad 3" with 16 items. Squad 1 has a list of tasks that are "Acquire domain for launch", "Hero site - development", "Integrate with backend", "Final creative shots from game", "Enable for teams", "Add leaderboard for Europe", "Marketing plan", "Email blast", and "Feedback intake". Squad 3 has a task labeled "Konami code easter egg". The main section displays a timeline showing when tasks will be completed.

_Bored of boards?_ Switch to tables and roadmaps. Create views for how you work. 
  * _Save views for sprints, backlogs, teams, or releases._ Rank, group, sort, slice and filter to suit the occasion. Create swimlanes, share templates and set work in progress limits.
  * _No mouse? No problem._ Every action you can take with the mouse has a keyboard shortcut or command. Filter, sort, group, and assign issues. Your hands never leave the keyboard.


### Custom fields
Track metadata like iterations, priority, story points, dates, notes, and links. Add custom fields to projects and edit from the issue sidebar. 
![The image shows a task management board with a dark theme. It is divided into columns for Assignees, Labels, and Cycles. Each row lists an assignee's name, the label associated with their task \(such as "Bug," "Need help," "Design," or "Back-end"\). There is dropdown menu expanded under the "cycle" column that shows different data types. The data types are "Text", "Number", "Date", "Single select", and iteration. "Text" is currently selected. The board is used to track tasks assigned to different individuals and their current status.](https://images.ctfassets.net/8aevphvgewt8/665ARAkl6YH4tPr0aWKDlL/d034ac805e10521fbff15a436be6f429/features-issues-river-3.webp)
### Track progress with project insights
Track the health of your current iteration cycle, milestone, or any other custom field you create with new project insights. Identify bottlenecks and issues blocking the team from making progress with the new burn up chart.
![The image shows a line graph with data from July 1 to July 13. The x-axis represents dates, and the y-axis represents numerical values from 0 to 175. Three lines are shown: purple for "Done", green for "In progress", blue for "To do", and pink for "No status". A tooltip on July 5 shows "Done: 74", "In progress: 55", "To do: 48", and "No status: 23".

### Share best practices with project templates
Create templates to share and reuse when getting started with a new project. Share inspiration across teams and get started with a single click.
![The image shows a project management dashboard titled "Team Planning" with tabs for Planning, Standup, and Iterations. The Planning tab is active, displaying six tasks under the "Kickoff" section. Tasks include confirming roles, verifying attendees, reviewing plans, creating release issues, writing a blog post, and setting up a daily triage loop. All tasks are marked as "Todo" with the milestone labeled "Kickoff".](https://images.ctfassets.net/8aevphvgewt8/510KpLxZ9zibGr4CstSNOA/47db94f0c15309cbf13a8e46a22bfc10/features-issues-river-5.webp)
## Manage work automatically  

Accelerate your project planning with workflows. Automatically triage issues, set values for custom fields, or archive issues.  
  

### Manage work automatically
![The image shows a sequence of three automation steps in a workflow. The first step is "When a channel mention is added and assigned," leading to the second step, "Archive item." The third step is "When an item is archived," leading to the final action.](https://images.ctfassets.net/8aevphvgewt8/QyISunpS5bIkepYsO2COA/18e17582b270652b1c1274c9178ef138/features-issues-flow-diagram.webp)

## What developers are saying   

“
> The new planning and tracking functionality keeps my project management close to my code. I no longer find myself needing to reach for spreadsheets or 3P tools which go stale instantly.

### Frequently asked questions
#### What is GitHub Issues?
We all need a way to plan our work, track issues, and discuss the things we build. Our answer to this universal question is GitHub Issues, and it’s built-in to every repository. GitHub’s issue tracking is unique because of our focus on simplicity, references, and elegant formatting.
With GitHub Issues, you can express ideas with GitHub Flavored Markdown, assign and mention contributors, react with emojis, clarify with attachments and videos, plus reference code like commits, pull requests, and deploys. With task lists, you can break big issues into tasks, further organize your work with milestones and labels, and track relationships and dependencies.
We built GitHub Issues for developers. It is simple, adaptable, and powerful.
#### What are Projects?
As teams and projects grow, how we work evolves. Tools that hard-code a methodology are too specific and rigid to adapt to any moment. Often, we find ourselves creating a spreadsheet or pulling out a notepad to have the space to think. Then our planning is disconnected from where the work happens.
The new Projects connect your planning directly to the work your teams are doing and flexibly adapt to whatever your team needs at any point. Built like a spreadsheet, project tables give you a live canvas to filter, sort, and group issues and pull requests. You can use it, or the accompanying project board, along with custom fields, to track a sprint, plan a feature, or manage a large-scale release.
#### What plans have access to Projects?
All users have access to the free tier of GitHub Issues and Projects. For more information about paid tiers, see our [pricing page](https://github.com/pricing?locale=en-US).
#### Will the new Projects experience be available in GitHub Enterprise Server?
Yes! GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES) support follows our regular cadence of one to two quarters before enabling the on-premises functionality.
