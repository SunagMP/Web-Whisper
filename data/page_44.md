## Application security   

### Application security where found means fixed. Powered by GitHub Copilot Autofix.
![Screenshot illustrating GitHub Advanced Security \(GHAS\) in action. The left side shows a line graph tracking the number of vulnerabilities by severity \(Critical, High, Moderate, Low\) over time, with data points from January 1 to February 15, 2024. The right side displays a security bot's recommendation to fix a vulnerability in the code. The bot explains that user-provided input is being used in an HTTP response without sanitization, potentially leading to a cross-site scripting \(XSS\) attack. The AI-suggested fix involves using the escape-html library to sanitize the input, with the old code in red and the new, corrected code in green. The background features a smooth blue gradient.](https://images.ctfassets.net/8aevphvgewt8/6xhL3DGJWO81pKW5fKbPXp/2df90d737a5113f939607b84ce4b09d9/section-security-illo.webp)
